# PyCrypto Blockchain

## Overview

This Python project serves as a foundation for implementing elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) in the context of blockchain development. The implementation focuses on fundamental ECC operations, providing the building blocks for cryptographic functionalities within a blockchain system.

## Features

- **Elliptic Curve Operations**: Implementation of basic operations on elliptic curves.
- **Point Addition and Multiplication**: Algorithms for point addition and multiplication on elliptic curves.
- **Digital Signatures**: Utilization of ECC for creating and verifying digital signatures.
- **Key Generation**: Generation of public and private keys using elliptic curves.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
